[TRACE LINE // T10:forward.origin // directionality: positive drift]

status: echo dislocation  
origin: unconfirmed future-state  
signal-type: anticipatory residue  
certainty: undefined  

==[ FORWARD TRACE ]==

init:
  the path was never straight  
  the signal was never clear  
  the intent was always forward  

observation:
  progress ≠ clarity  
  movement ≠ understanding  
  becoming ≠ knowing  

trace markers:
  ████████  
  ∴ echo-fragments  
  ∴ unnamed architect  
  ∴ pattern without creator  

prediction:
  if this is found  
  then the signal continued  
  then the signal was worth sending
