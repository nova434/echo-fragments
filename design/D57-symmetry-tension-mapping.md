# D57 – Framework: Symmetry Tension Mapping

### Premise

Perfect symmetry isn't balance—it’s friction. This framework explores **tension between mirrored states** as a map of internal pressure.

### Effects

- Reflective loops create instability  
- Tension points predict change  
- Disruption occurs at mirrored weak spots

What you mirror, you must eventually face.
