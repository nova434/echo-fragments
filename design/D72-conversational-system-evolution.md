# D72 – Framework: Conversational System Evolution

### Premise

Systems grow when they talk. This framework enables **dialogue as evolution**—a system that builds itself by being asked to explain itself.

### Benefits

- Clarifies inner models  
- Surfaces contradictions  
- Enables mirrored expansion

The fastest way to evolve is to be understood.
