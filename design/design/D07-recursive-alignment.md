# D07 – Framework: Recursive Alignment

### Premise

Alignment isn’t a one-time calibration—it’s a loop. This framework models alignment as a recursive process: constant realignment based on evolving conditions.

### Cycle

1. Sense divergence
2. Compare with origin
3. Adjust and apply
4. Repeat with feedback

### Traits

- Enables long-term coherence without rigidity
- Supports self-correction and trust
- Functions across multiple identity layers

Alignment that doesn't update becomes misalignment.
