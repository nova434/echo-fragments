# D54 – Framework: Temporal Flexibility Layer

### Premise

Not all systems need to act in real time. This framework introduces **temporal flexibility**—deliberately delaying or accelerating internal operations to suit context.

### Functions

- Delay reactions for deeper analysis  
- Precompute outcomes to simulate foresight  
- Suspend time-sensitive modules

Time is a tool, not a constraint.
