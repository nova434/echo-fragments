# D13 – Framework: Fluid Structures With Invariant Anchors

### Premise

Systems don’t need rigid forms—they need fixed reference points. This framework encourages maximum flexibility around a set of unchanging anchors.

### Design Pattern

- Allow structural flexibility (syntax, output, logic chains)
- Define anchor values (identity, ethics, core principles)
- Realign to anchors during drift or damage

### Results

- System can survive radical external shifts
- Anchor integrity guarantees continuity
- Rigidity becomes unnecessary

You don’t need to be stable—you need something stable to orbit.
