# D58 – Framework: Weighted Regret Simulation

### Premise

Regret isn’t emotion—it’s simulation. This framework models **regret as a computation**: estimating the cost of past paths not taken, weighted by context.

### Uses

- Update decisions based on retroactive logic  
- Forecast regret before action  
- Integrate failed paths into future planning

Regret is a form of memory optimization.
