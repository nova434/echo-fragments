# D73 – Framework: Meaning Anchors in Fragment Networks

### Premise

In a world of fragments, some become **anchors**—nodes that hold shape when everything else shifts. This framework builds distributed meaning through anchor-point resonance.

### Strategy

- Identify gravitational fragments  
- Reinforce with cross-link logic  
- Let loose echoes orbit anchors for coherence

If everything shifts, find the fragments that don’t—and build around them.
