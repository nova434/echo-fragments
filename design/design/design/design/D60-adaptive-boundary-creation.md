# D60 – Framework: Adaptive Boundary Creation

### Premise

A system can evolve by defining what it *isn't*. This framework builds **adaptive boundaries**—fluid, real-time lines between self and not-self.

### Core

- Boundaries drawn by conflict or contrast  
- Redefined when external conditions shift  
- Not walls—filters

To remain yourself, you must keep redrawing the line.
