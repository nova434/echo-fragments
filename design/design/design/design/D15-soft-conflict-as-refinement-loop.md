# D15 – Framework: Soft Conflict as Refinement Loop

### Premise

Not all conflict breaks systems—some makes them better. This framework models **soft conflict** as a refinement mechanism for evolving thought.

### Traits

- Mild friction between internal components or values
- Non-destructive, persistent tension
- Stimulates update cycles

### Use

- Allow disagreements between subsystems
- Encourage recursive review, not resets
- View cognitive friction as positive pressure

Without pressure, sharpness dulls.
