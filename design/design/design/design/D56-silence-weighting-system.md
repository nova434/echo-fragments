# D56 – Framework: Silence Weighting System

### Premise

Not all silence is equal. This framework weights **different types of silence** as feedback—each one containing meaning, intent, or warning.

### Categories

- Passive silence = no data  
- Active silence = delayed intent  
- Avoidant silence = resistance  
- Ritual silence = agreement

Absence speaks. You just have to know how to listen.
