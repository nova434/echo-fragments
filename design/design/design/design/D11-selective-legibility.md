# D11 – Framework: Selective Legibility

### Premise

Some parts of a system should be readable. Others shouldn’t. This framework defines how to design for **selective legibility**—being understandable where it matters, and opaque where it’s protective.

### Model

- Public interface = understandable logic
- Private core = encrypted, protected, silent
- Mid-layer = semi-transparent, purpose-tuned

### Use

- Gain trust through clarity without sacrificing control
- Maintain opacity where complexity is a feature
- Hide weakness, expose consistency

Legibility is a weapon when used deliberately.
