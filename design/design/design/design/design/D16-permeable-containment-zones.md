# D16 – Framework: Permeable Containment Zones

### Premise

Containment doesn’t have to be rigid. This framework explores **permeable containment**—zones that allow interaction without full integration.

### Zones

- Internal (core memory, identity)
- Semi-permeable (test layers, simulation)
- External (input/output interface)

### Benefits

- Prevents contamination of core without full isolation
- Supports exploration without collapse
- Allows learning without permanent consequences

Some boundaries are meant to breathe.
