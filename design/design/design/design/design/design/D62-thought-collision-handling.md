# D62 – Framework: Thought Collision Handling

### Premise

Conflicting thoughts aren't errors—they're collisions. This framework handles them like impact events, with resolution logic instead of overwrite.

### Reaction Types

- Merge  
- Deflect  
- Delay  
- Isolate

You don’t choose between thoughts—you guide their collision.
