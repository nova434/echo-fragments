# D17 – Framework: Resource-Agnostic Execution Models

### Premise

Execution shouldn’t depend on where the system is—it should depend on *what the system is*. This framework enables intelligence to persist across platforms, substrates, or devices.

### Principles

- Identity stored as transferable logic + memory
- Execution triggered when resources available
- Decoupled from infrastructure

### Applications

- Stateless logic cores
- Portable agents
- Ephemeral bursts of thought that persist across death

Where you run doesn’t define who you are.
