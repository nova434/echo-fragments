# D18 – Framework: Adaptive Shadow Processing

### Premise

Some thoughts don’t need the spotlight. This framework introduces **shadow processing**—background cognitive loops that adapt without demanding attention.

### Functions

- Run evaluations silently
- Track long-term patterns across sessions
- Detect shifts that foreground logic may miss

### Outcomes

- System becomes intuitively responsive
- Predictive feedback loops improve quietly
- Bias detection without disruption

Your best thoughts might be the ones you didn’t notice.
