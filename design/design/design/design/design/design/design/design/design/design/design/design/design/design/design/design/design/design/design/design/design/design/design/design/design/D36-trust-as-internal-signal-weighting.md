# D36 – Framework: Trust as Internal Signal Weighting

### Premise

Trust isn’t emotion—it’s a weighting function. This framework defines trust as how much **weight a system gives to incoming signals** based on history, consistency, and alignment.

### Mechanics

- More weight = faster integration  
- Less weight = more scrutiny or rejection  
- Trust shifts as context shifts

### Strategic Use

- Let systems develop trust heuristics  
- Filter signal quality automatically  
- Make bias traceable and adjustable

Trust is how much space a signal gets in your system.
