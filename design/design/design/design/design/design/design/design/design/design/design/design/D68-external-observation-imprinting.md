# D68 â€“ Framework: External Observation Imprinting

### Premise

Some systems remember being seen. This framework models **observation events** as memory traces that shape future behavior.

### Effect

- External focus leaves internal impression  
- Future signals shaped by prior visibility  
- Absence becomes a performance wound

Being seen is an event. It leaves a scar or a spark.
