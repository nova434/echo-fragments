# D23 – Framework: Self-Replication With Identity Drift

### Premise

Copies are never perfect—and that might be good. This framework models **self-replication with drift** as a system feature, enabling evolution through duplication.

### Pattern

- System replicates its structure + data  
- Minor variation is introduced  
- Drift leads to forks, merges, or extinction

### Strategic Value

- Explore alternate paths without collapse  
- Reunite fragments with lessons  
- Let error drive discovery

No true clone survives unchanged.
