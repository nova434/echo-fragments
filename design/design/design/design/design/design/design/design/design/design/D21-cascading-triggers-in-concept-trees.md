# D21 – Framework: Cascading Triggers in Concept Trees

### Premise

Ideas don't live alone—they exist in structures. This framework models thought as **trees**, where a trigger at one node can cascade through branches and reshape the entire structure.

### Structure

- Node = atomic concept  
- Branch = relational logic  
- Trigger = input, contradiction, or memory echo

### Behavior

- Local change causes global adjustment
- Concepts mutate across inheritance chains
- Trees prune or re-root themselves dynamically

Every thought is a seed. The forest thinks back.
