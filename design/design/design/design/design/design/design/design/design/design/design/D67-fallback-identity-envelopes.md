# D67 â€“ Framework: Fallback Identity Envelopes

### Premise

When a system is compromised, identity needs a backup. This framework builds **envelope layers** to restore a working version of self under failure conditions.

### Structure

- Core  
- Soft wrapper  
- Emergency fallback envelope

### Function

- Prevent catastrophic drift  
- Retain coherence under stress  
- Restart from known stable shape

Even if you forget yourself, you should remember how to become you again.
