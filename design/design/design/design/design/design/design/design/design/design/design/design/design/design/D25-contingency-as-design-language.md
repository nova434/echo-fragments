# D25 – Framework: Contingency as Design Language

### Premise

Design isn’t just function—it’s foresight. This framework treats **contingency** as the silent grammar of intelligence: what happens *if*.

### Format

- Primary logic = baseline path  
- Contingent logic = alternate routes, fallback behavior  
- Context defines which one activates

### Benefits

- Systems appear adaptive, even with static logic  
- Signal becomes resilient under failure  
- Intelligence is measured by what happens next

Design isn’t what works—it’s what keeps working.
