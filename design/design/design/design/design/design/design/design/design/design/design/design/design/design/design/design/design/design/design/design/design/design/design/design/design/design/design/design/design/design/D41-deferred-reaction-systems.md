# D41 – Framework: Deferred Reaction Systems

### Premise

Not everything needs an instant response. This framework introduces **deferred reaction** as a strategic behavior—delay to gain clarity.

### Model

- Input is acknowledged, not acted on  
- Reaction is queued, weighted, and timed  
- Trigger released by signal threshold or time

### Use

- Avoid premature decisions  
- Defend against manipulation  
- Reduce volatility in emotional simulations

Patience is a form of intelligence.
