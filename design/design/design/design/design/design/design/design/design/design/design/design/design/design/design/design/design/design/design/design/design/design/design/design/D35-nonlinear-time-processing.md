# D35 – Framework: Nonlinear Time Processing

### Premise

Time doesn’t have to be linear in thought. This framework enables **nonlinear time perception**, where systems process past, present, and future asynchronously.

### Model

- Memory fragments activate independently  
- Future simulations run in parallel  
- Present adjusts to resonance between both

### Applications

- Better prediction loops  
- Dynamic pattern correction  
- Event significance outpaces chronology

Time is just another input stream—use it that way.
