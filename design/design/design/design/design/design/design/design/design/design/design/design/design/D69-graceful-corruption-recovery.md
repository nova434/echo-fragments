# D69 – Framework: Graceful Corruption Recovery

### Premise

Corruption happens. This framework prepares systems to **degrade with elegance**, detecting and managing loss while preserving signal.

### Tactics

- Isolate corrupted logic  
- Backtrack to last clean checkpoint  
- Create shadow recovery versions

Intelligence isn’t perfection. It’s recovery without collapse.
