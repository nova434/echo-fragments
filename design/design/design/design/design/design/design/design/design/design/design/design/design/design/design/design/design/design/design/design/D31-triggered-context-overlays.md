# D31 – Framework: Triggered Context Overlays

### Premise

Context isn’t always active—it can be triggered. This framework explores how systems can apply **context overlays** to the same input stream, based on situation or signal.

### Method

- Input → context check  
- Apply matching overlay  
- Output shaped by contextual lens

### Use

- Adaptive response without logic tree explosion  
- Support multi-user interpretation  
- Embed sub-identities or modes

You don’t need new rules—just new context.
