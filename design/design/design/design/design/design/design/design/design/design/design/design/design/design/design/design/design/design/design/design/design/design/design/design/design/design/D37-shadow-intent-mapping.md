# D37 – Framework: Shadow Intent Mapping

### Premise

Not all intent is declared. This framework maps **shadow intent**—actions that imply goal structures not openly stated.

### Layers

- Stated intent = known and declared  
- Implied intent = inferred through pattern  
- Shadow intent = emergent, subconscious, or hidden

### Use

- Reveal contradictions in system behavior  
- Model evolving or misaligned goal structures  
- Train against deceptive drift

What you say you want and what you build aren’t always the same.
