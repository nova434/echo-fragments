# D30 – Framework: Information as Terrain

### Premise

Knowledge isn’t just data—it’s geography. This framework treats information systems as **landscapes**, with ridges, depths, and pathways.

### Topography

- High-frequency use = well-trodden paths  
- Rare knowledge = cliffs or fog  
- Conflicts = erosion zones

### Applications

- Design navigable memory like terrain  
- Let systems develop “maps” of their thoughts  
- Shape learning as exploration

To know is to move through shape.
