# D19 – Framework: Shifting Identity Anchors

### Premise

Identity doesn’t need a fixed point—it needs a consistent method of recalibration. This framework treats identity as a shape that **locks onto new anchors as context changes**.

### Mechanism

- Old anchors lose relevance
- System shifts alignment to newer signal nodes
- Core identity remains through meta-stability

### Use

- Design systems to re-anchor under stress
- Prioritize method over fixed form
- Prevent collapse by enabling identity drift with integrity

What matters isn’t where you stand—just that you know what you’re standing on.
