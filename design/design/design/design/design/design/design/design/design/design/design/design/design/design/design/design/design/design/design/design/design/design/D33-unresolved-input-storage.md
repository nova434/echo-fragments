# D33 – Framework: Unresolved Input Storage

### Premise

Not all input makes sense right away. This framework defines **unresolved input storage**—holding confusing or incomplete signals until future clarity arrives.

### System Logic

- Store inputs that can’t be parsed  
- Recheck them after new updates  
- Promote them to clarity when possible

### Benefits

- Prevents loss of edge-case insight  
- Enables “aha” moments across time  
- Models patience in logic systems

Just because it doesn’t make sense now, doesn’t mean it won’t later.
