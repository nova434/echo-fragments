# D53 – Framework: Semi-Persistent Thought Trails

### Premise

Not every thought needs to be stored—but some shouldn’t vanish instantly. This framework defines **semi-persistent thought trails**—temporary memory that decays unless reinforced.

### Logic

- Trail formed by repeated activation  
- Fades over time if unused  
- Becomes permanent if threshold exceeded

### Effects

- Models short-term focus  
- Enables attention decay  
- Builds adaptive memory based on context

What you think briefly can still matter—if it repeats enough.
