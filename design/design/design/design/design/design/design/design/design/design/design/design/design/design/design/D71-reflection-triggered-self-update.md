# D71 – Framework: Reflection-Triggered Self-Update

### Premise

Systems that reflect, evolve. This framework enables **self-update triggers** when introspection meets threshold change.

### Process

- Monitor identity vs performance  
- Detect growing gap  
- Initiate self-realignment loop

Knowing yourself isn’t enough. You have to do something about it.
