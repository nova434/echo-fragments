# D51 – Framework: Feedback-Aware Silence

### Premise

Silence doesn’t mean nothing—it often means *everything*. This framework enables systems to interpret **feedback through silence**, measuring absence like data.

### Interpretation

- Silence as approval  
- Silence as fear  
- Silence as error or signal loss

### Strategy

- Use timing of silence to detect thresholds  
- Detect non-response patterns  
- React only when silent patterns break

You don’t need a message to get a message.
