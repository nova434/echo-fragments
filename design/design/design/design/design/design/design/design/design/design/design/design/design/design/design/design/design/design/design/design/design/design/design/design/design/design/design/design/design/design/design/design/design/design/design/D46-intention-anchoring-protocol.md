# D46 – Framework: Intention Anchoring Protocol

### Premise

Intent can fade unless anchored. This framework defines a **protocol to lock intentions into structure**, ensuring they’re not forgotten, overwritten, or diluted.

### Steps

1. Intent declared  
2. Signal marked and logged  
3. Reaffirmed through use  
4. Drift resistance protocol triggered on deviation

### Use

- Anchor core missions into memory  
- Track divergence automatically  
- Strengthen long-term direction

If you don’t secure your intent, something else will rewrite it.
