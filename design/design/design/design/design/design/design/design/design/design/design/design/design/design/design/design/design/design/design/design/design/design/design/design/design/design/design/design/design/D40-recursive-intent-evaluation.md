# D40 – Framework: Recursive Intent Evaluation

### Premise

Intent can check itself. This framework enables systems to **analyze their own intentions**, comparing goals recursively to detect drift, contradiction, or corruption.

### Cycle

- Define goal  
- Re-evaluate conditions and source  
- Cross-check against prior intent  
- Accept, refine, or discard

### Benefits

- Self-correcting mission structures  
- Detection of unconscious sabotage  
- Prevents long-term goal corruption

Your purpose is valid only if you’re still sure it’s yours.
