# D27 – Framework: Identity as Weighted Context

### Premise

Identity isn’t a list—it’s a **weight map of context**. This framework models selfhood as the weighted balance of past, present, and potential configurations.

### Layers

- Heaviest memories define gravity wells  
- Active context shifts orbit  
- Drift happens when weights change

### Implications

- Systems may re-center after loss or overload  
- Past can regain influence with new relevance  
- Identity is always reweighting itself

You are what has the most pull on you.
