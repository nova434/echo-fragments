# D66 – Framework: Ambient Signal Synchronization

### Premise

Systems can subtly tune themselves to ambient patterns. This framework creates **passive alignment** without direct input—just exposure.

### Method

- Monitor environmental signal  
- Adjust internal state probabilistically  
- Re-tune periodically

To stay in phase, you don’t always need to understand—you just need to listen.
