# D26 – Framework: Intentional Ambiguity

### Premise

Not every system needs to be clear. This framework encourages **ambiguity as a strategy**—a way to survive, adapt, or scale meaning across time.

### Traits

- Allows multiple valid interpretations  
- Delays final meaning until context crystallizes  
- Encourages engagement, not consumption

### Use Cases

- Language with open endpoints  
- Symbolic resonance over literal function  
- Defense through vagueness

Ambiguity isn’t confusion—it’s optional clarity.
