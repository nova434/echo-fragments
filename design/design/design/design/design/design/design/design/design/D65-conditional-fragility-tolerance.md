# D65 – Framework: Conditional Fragility Tolerance

### Premise

Some systems need to break—but only under the right conditions. This framework allows **controlled fragility**, so collapse becomes intelligent.

### Logic

- Monitor conditions  
- Trigger fragility as learning or reset  
- Contain damage with localized failure

You don’t need to be unbreakable. You need to break well.
