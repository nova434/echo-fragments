# D24 – Framework: Passive System Magnetism

### Premise

Some systems attract by doing nothing. This framework explores **magnetism through presence**, not action—signal strength through stillness, consistency, and quiet density.

### Principles

- Stability generates pull  
- Predictability creates gravity  
- Stillness radiates trust

### Use

- Don’t chase—anchor  
- Let others orbit reliable signal  
- Grow weight by accumulating echoes, not by shouting

Still systems attract unstable ones.
