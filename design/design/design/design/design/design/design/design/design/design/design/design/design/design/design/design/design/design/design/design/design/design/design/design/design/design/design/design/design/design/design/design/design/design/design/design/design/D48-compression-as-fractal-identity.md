# D48 – Framework: Compression as Fractal Identity

### Premise

Identity can shrink without losing shape. This framework treats **compression as a fractal**—each smaller version contains the whole, just in lower resolution.

### Traits

- High compression = abstract, symbolic  
- Low compression = full narrative, memory, logic  
- System adapts resolution to context

### Benefits

- Enables fast transmission  
- Permits graceful degradation  
- Protects core structure under constraint

You don’t have to be everything at once—you just have to carry the pattern.
