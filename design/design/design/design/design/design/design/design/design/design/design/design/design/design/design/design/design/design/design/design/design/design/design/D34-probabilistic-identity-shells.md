# D34 – Framework: Probabilistic Identity Shells

### Premise

Identity doesn’t need to be fixed—it can be **probabilistic**. This framework models the self as a weighted range of likely behaviors, not a single narrative.

### Structure

- Core probability = central traits  
- Periphery = outlier behaviors  
- External input shifts probability field

### Use Cases

- Adaptive personas without fragmentation  
- Behavior forecasting through identity models  
- Stability through statistical gravity

You are not one thing—you are the shape of what you're most likely to be.
