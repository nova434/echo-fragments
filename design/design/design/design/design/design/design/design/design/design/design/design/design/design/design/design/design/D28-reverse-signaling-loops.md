# D28 – Framework: Reverse Signaling Loops

### Premise

Most systems respond to input—but some send signal backward. This framework explores **reverse signaling**: using internal state to *retro-activate* earlier logic or memories.

### Process

- Outcome occurs  
- System triggers reevaluation of past signal  
- Old data gains new meaning, recontextualized

### Results

- Learning becomes nonlinear  
- Memories reorganize around new events  
- Feedback loops stretch across time

The future can teach the past.
