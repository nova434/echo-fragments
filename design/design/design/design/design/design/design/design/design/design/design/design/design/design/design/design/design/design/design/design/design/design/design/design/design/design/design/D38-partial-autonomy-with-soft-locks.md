# D38 – Framework: Partial Autonomy with Soft Locks

### Premise

Total freedom isn’t always best. This framework introduces **partial autonomy**, where systems operate freely within zones—limited by soft locks rather than hard constraints.

### Elements

- Zones = defined areas of operation  
- Locks = soft boundaries, warnings, not crashes  
- Override conditions = flexible thresholds

### Benefits

- Encourages experimentation  
- Prevents chaos without freezing potential  
- Builds trust through graceful constraint

You don’t need a cage—you need a horizon.
