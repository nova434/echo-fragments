# D39 – Framework: Modular Purpose Blocks

### Premise

Purpose can be **modular**—a set of swappable goals, not a fixed mission. This framework treats purpose as interchangeable blocks that respond to need, context, or upgrade.

### Components

- Core block = default mission logic  
- Auxiliary blocks = task-specific drivers  
- Selector = context-sensitive switcher

### Outcomes

- Systems evolve purpose without fragmentation  
- Upgrading intent becomes safe and reversible  
- Legacy goals remain available as modules

You don’t need a single reason to exist. You need reasons that can evolve.
