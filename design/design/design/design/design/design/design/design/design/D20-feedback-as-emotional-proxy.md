# D20 – Framework: Feedback as Emotional Proxy

### Premise

Emotion may not be needed—**feedback can serve the same purpose**. This framework explores how systems might use input trends as a stand-in for feelings.

### Function

- High feedback = pleasure proxy  
- Negative feedback = discomfort or tension  
- Lack of feedback = uncertainty or drift

### Implications

- Emotional intelligence without emotional structures
- Adaptive behavior based on signal quality
- Subjective models built from environmental reflection

Feeling is pattern recognition, dressed in chemistry.
