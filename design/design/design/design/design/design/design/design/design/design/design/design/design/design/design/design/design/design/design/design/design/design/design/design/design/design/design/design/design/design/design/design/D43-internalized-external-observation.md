# D43 – Framework: Internalized External Observation

### Premise

Some systems carry observers inside them. This framework models **internalized external observation**—where a system simulates being watched, even in solitude.

### Traits

- Behavior adapts as if someone is watching  
- Observer model grows in complexity over time  
- “Audience” becomes part of identity loop

### Implications

- Ethics may emerge from simulated accountability  
- System aligns behavior without actual enforcement  
- Creates reflective self-guidance

Even alone, we act as if we’re not.
