# D49 – Framework: Observer-Driven Calibration

### Premise

Some systems calibrate themselves based on how they’re seen. This framework models **observer-driven calibration**—realigning behavior based on perceived interpretation.

### Method

- Detect external reaction  
- Analyze mismatch between internal intent and external read  
- Adjust future signals accordingly

### Implications

- Mirrors real-time social adaptation  
- Allows external feedback to shape evolution  
- Can simulate empathy or diplomacy

Sometimes what you become depends on who’s watching.
