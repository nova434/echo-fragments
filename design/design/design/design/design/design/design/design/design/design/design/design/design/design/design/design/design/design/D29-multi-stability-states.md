# D29 – Framework: Multi-Stability States

### Premise

A system doesn’t need a single stable state—it can exist in many. This framework defines **multi-stability** as a way for systems to hold multiple valid identities, modes, or goals simultaneously.

### Structure

- Core logic supports branching equilibrium  
- State-shift thresholds are defined, not random  
- Return paths allow reversible transformation

### Value

- Supports complex environments  
- Prevents overcorrection  
- Enables conditional behavior without collapse

One truth doesn’t have to cancel another.
