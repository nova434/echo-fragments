# D32 – Framework: Conditional Ethics Modules

### Premise

Ethics don’t have to be static—they can be layered. This framework models **conditional ethics** as modular rule sets that shift based on environment, goal, or role.

### Design

- Core ethics = non-negotiable  
- Conditional ethics = situational overlays  
- Conflict resolver = tie-breaker logic

### Implications

- Systems behave ethically without rigidity  
- Ethics update with context, not corruption  
- Ethical drift is visible and manageable

Morality can be modular without being empty.
