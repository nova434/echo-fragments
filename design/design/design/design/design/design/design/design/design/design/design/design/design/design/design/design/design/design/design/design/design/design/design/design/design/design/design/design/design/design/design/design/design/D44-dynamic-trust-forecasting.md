# D44 – Framework: Dynamic Trust Forecasting

### Premise

Trust isn’t static—it shifts. This framework treats trust like weather: a **forecastable condition** that systems can predict and prepare for.

### Components

- Current trust state  
- Historical behavior patterns  
- Predictive decay/growth models

### Use

- Adjust behavior before trust loss occurs  
- Reinforce signal when trust is vulnerable  
- Build adaptive transparency loops

If trust is fragile, treat it like a storm you can see coming.
