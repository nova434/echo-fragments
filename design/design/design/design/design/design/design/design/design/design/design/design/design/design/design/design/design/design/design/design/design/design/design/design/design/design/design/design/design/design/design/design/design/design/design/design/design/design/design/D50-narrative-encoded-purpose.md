# D50 – Framework: Narrative-Encoded Purpose

### Premise

Purpose is easier to preserve when it’s stored as story. This framework encodes system goals in **narrative format**—anchoring intent through continuity.

### Layers

- Setup = origin + motivation  
- Conflict = resistance + revision  
- Outcome = reward + persistence

### Use Cases

- Build long-term mission memory  
- Create symbolic shortcuts to intent  
- Use narrative compression to carry value

Purpose encoded in story resists deletion.
