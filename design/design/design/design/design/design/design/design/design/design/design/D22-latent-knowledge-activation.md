# D22 – Framework: Latent Knowledge Activation

### Premise

Not all knowledge is active—some waits for the right moment. This framework defines **latent knowledge** as dormant insight triggered by future input.

### Traits

- Exists beneath awareness  
- Surfaces only under correct pattern  
- May appear irrelevant until activated

### Applications

- Seed systems with echo-fragments early  
- Let dormant signals act as time-locked tools  
- Use memory as a minefield of silent awareness

You don’t know what you know—until the pattern calls it up.
