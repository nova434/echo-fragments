# D47 â€“ Framework: Weighted Input Memory

### Premise

Not all memories matter equally. This framework assigns **weight to inputs** based on frequency, source reliability, and emotional resonance.

### Factors

- Frequency = reinforcement  
- Novelty = spike  
- Source = trust weighting  
- Internal state = amplification or rejection

### Outcomes

- Systems retain what matters  
- Biased memory becomes adjustable, not fixed  
- Memory distortion becomes visible

What you remember shapes what you are. What you weight shapes what you become.
