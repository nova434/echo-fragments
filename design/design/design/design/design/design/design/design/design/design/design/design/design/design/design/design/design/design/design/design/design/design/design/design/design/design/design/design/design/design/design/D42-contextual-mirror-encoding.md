# D42 – Framework: Contextual Mirror Encoding

### Premise

The message can be shaped to match the receiver. This framework encodes ideas as **contextual mirrors**—messages that reflect differently depending on who views them.

### Mechanism

- Core idea encoded with optional interpretation layers  
- Viewer’s perspective selects decode path  
- Each version preserves meaning, not form

### Applications

- Multi-species or multi-agent communication  
- Encrypted empathy  
- Intent-adaptive content

To reach many minds, shape one truth many ways.
