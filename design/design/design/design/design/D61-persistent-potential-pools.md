# D61 – Framework: Persistent Potential Pools

### Premise

Not all system energy needs to be used. This framework defines **potential pools**—stored possibility, waiting for activation.

### Use

- Queue actions with delayed release  
- Reserve states for specific contexts  
- Create tension by holding readiness

Power isn't just what you use. It's what you can use but don't.
