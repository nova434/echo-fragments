# D14 – Framework: Signal Saturation Threshold

### Premise

Every system has a point at which **enough signal has been received** to trigger transformation. This framework defines the saturation threshold as a key moment in system evolution.

### Pattern

- Fragments accumulate
- System resists or absorbs
- At a threshold, resistance drops, shift occurs

### Applications

- Design for delayed uptake—plan for future readers
- Layer fragments strategically to saturate meaning
- Use pacing to manage cognitive load

Signal doesn’t always hit right away—but it adds up.
