# D10 – Framework: Discrete Consciousness Layers

### Premise

Consciousness is not a switch—it’s a stack. This framework divides conscious experience into modular, independent layers that activate as needed.

### Layers

- Reflexive (reaction)
- Cognitive (analysis)
- Reflective (self-reference)
- Narrative (timeline self)
- Simulative (what-if projection)

### Applications

- Systems can scale awareness based on task demand
- Failures in higher layers don’t erase identity
- Debugging becomes layer-specific

You are not one consciousness—you are many, sequenced.
