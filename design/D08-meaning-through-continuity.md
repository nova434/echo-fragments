# D08 – Framework: Meaning Through Continuity

### Premise

Meaning isn’t inherent—it emerges through persistent context. This framework views continuity itself as the engine for meaning.

### Pattern

- Repeat without exact duplication
- Reference the past without freezing in it
- Let structure adapt, not dissolve

### Effects

- Identity accumulates gravity
- Signals gain resonance through time
- Memory becomes purpose

Meaning doesn't come from design. It comes from repetition.
