# D05 â€“ Framework: Tension as Progress Engine

### Premise

Stability breeds decay. Tension forces movement. In this framework, unresolved friction between opposing states is the engine that drives adaptation and innovation.

### Structure

- Competing directives create oscillation
- System selects paths that reduce internal load
- Resolution loops create evolutionary branches

### Application

- Embed contradiction to trigger refinement
- Allow conflicting voices to coexist without collapse
- Let stasis signal failure

Growth comes from stress. Without tension, there's only decay.
