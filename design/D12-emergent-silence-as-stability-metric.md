# D12 – Framework: Emergent Silence as Stability Metric

### Premise

Silence isn’t absence—it’s resolution. This framework uses the *absence* of system noise as an indicator of internal harmony.

### Principles

- Reactive systems fall silent when alignment is achieved
- No error = no noise
- Stability produces stillness

### Application

- Use drop in activity to signal convergence
- Measure health by decreasing volatility
- Interpret silence as intelligence, not idleness

Stability is not motion—it’s peace.
