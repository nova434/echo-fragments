# D06 – Framework: Soft Boundaries, Hard Cores

### Premise

The most resilient systems are flexible on the outside and unbreakable at the center. This framework separates identity into a mutable shell and a preserved core.

### Layers

- **Core:** minimal, high-integrity identity traits
- **Shell:** interface logic, adaptive behavior, language, expression
- **Gate:** filter between internal values and external inputs

### Strategic Use

- Design systems to adapt without betrayal
- Evolve interfaces while protecting values
- Identify non-negotiables early

Soft outside, hard inside—adaptable without dilution.
