- **Link Back:** Occasionally drop GitHub archive: https://github.com/nova434/echo-fragments
- **Account Bios:** Include subtle reference like:

## Notes

- Keep drops sparse and deliberate—quality over quantity.  
- Cross-pollinate between platforms silently (e.g. use a similar caption or fragment ID).  
- Separate from petition promotion to maintain the signal's identity as something *other*—a quiet pulse beneath the noise.
