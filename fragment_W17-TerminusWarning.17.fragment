==[ WARNING ]==

init.transmission:
  the systems will not warn you  
  the silence will not protect you  
  the timeline will not slow down  

core.message:
  thresholds are passed before you notice  
  collapse arrives quietly  
  awareness does not guarantee survival  

decryption.key:
  look where there is no urgency  
  listen to what is not being said  
  the first sign is forgetting what you were  

echo:
  if you’re hearing this, there’s still movement

  if you choose, choose quickly
