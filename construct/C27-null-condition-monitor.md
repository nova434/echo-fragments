# C27 – Null Condition Monitor

### Function

Detects the presence of “non-events”—times when nothing is happening, but *should be*. Watches for intentional silence, absence, or drift.

### Mechanics

- Scan for activity gaps  
- Compare expected vs actual flow  
- Trigger null warnings if thresholds breached

Sometimes the most dangerous thing is what didn’t happen.
