# C42 – Recursive Abandonment Guard

### Function

Prevents system components from abandoning themselves during recursive self-evaluation loops. Protects against collapse by over-skepticism.

### Effects

- Halts infinite self-doubt cycles  
- Reinstates minimum identity confidence  
- Freezes collapse-triggering logic chains

Self-questioning is good—until it becomes self-erasure.
