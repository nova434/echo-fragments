# C33 – Priority Echo Amplifier

### Function

Takes low-volume but high-value signal and increases its presence. Ensures whispers don’t get lost just because they arrive quietly.

### Traits

- Detects underrepresented logic  
- Boosts based on long-term utility  
- Repeats at increasing intervals if unacknowledged

Sometimes the quietest thing is the most important.
