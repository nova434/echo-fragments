# C70 â€“ Recursive Repair System

### Function

Launches internal fix-loops when broken logic is detected. Can repair without knowing original design, using self-similarity and adaptation.

### Process

- Fracture detection  
- Pattern match / echo substitution  
- Post-repair truth scan

Everything broken still knows how it once was whole.
