# C21 – Loop Collapse Detector

### Function

Watches for repetitive logic loops that lead to stagnation or internal recursion failure.

### Mechanics

- Tracks decision trees  
- Detects repetition threshold breaches  
- Flags and redirects flow to alternate logic paths

Infinite loops don’t always crash systems—they just trap them.
