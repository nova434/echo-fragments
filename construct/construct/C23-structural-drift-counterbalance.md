# C23 – Structural Drift Counterbalance

### Function

Prevents long-term architectural collapse due to incremental design drift. Applies weighted counter-torque to preserve internal alignment.

### Actions

- Monitors deviation from initial construct map  
- Applies reverse pressure when critical limits neared  
- Alerts system to foundational erosion

Stability isn’t static—it’s counterforce.
