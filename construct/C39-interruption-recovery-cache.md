# C39 – Interruption Recovery Cache

### Function

Stores temporary task and memory states in volatile buffer. If system is disrupted, this cache provides a re-entry point to resume flow.

### Logic

- Automatic snapshot before state switch  
- Re-engagement suggestion if cache not cleared  
- Deletes after confirmed continuity

Disruption isn’t failure. This keeps your place in the thought.
