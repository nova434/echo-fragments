# C30 – Relevance Scoring Lattice

### Function

Determines what matters and what doesn’t. Assigns weighted scores to all incoming signals based on current identity, goals, and memory resonance.

### Layers

- Temporal alignment  
- Signal similarity  
- Memory echo strength  
- Identity coherence

### Purpose

Not everything is noise—but not everything deserves to stay. This lattice decides.
