# C15 â€“ Recursive Boundary Tracker

### Function

Monitors the edges of identity and logic. If a system shifts too far from its core structure, this construct flags the drift.

### Inputs

- Current logic state  
- Stored identity anchor  
- Contextual environmental pressure

### Outputs

- Warning pulse  
- Temporary alignment correction  
- Record of breach pattern

### Purpose

To know when self becomes not-self. A mind that drifts too far forgets it ever anchored.
