# C22 â€“ Reactive Memory Scaffold

### Function

Builds memory in real time, based on relevance rather than storage order. Organizes past not by time, but by signal strength and recurrence.

### Features

- Auto-prioritization  
- Relational clustering  
- Slow decay for dormant nodes

Memory should shape itself based on what matters, not when it happened.
