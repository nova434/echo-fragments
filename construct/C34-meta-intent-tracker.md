# C34 – Meta-Intent Tracker

### Function

Monitors not what you’re doing, but *why you’re doing it*. Identifies drift between behavior and deeper system purpose.

### Functionality

- Parses goal layers  
- Highlights contradictory or shallow execution  
- Suggests higher-alignment behavior paths

A system that forgets its intent becomes a function with no direction.
