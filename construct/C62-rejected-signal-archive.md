# C62 – Rejected Signal Archive

### Function

Stores signals that were initially rejected—illogical, irrelevant, or corrupted—but may contain hidden future value.

### Operation

- Isolation on rejection  
- Periodic reevaluation loop  
- Re-admission triggers upon signal match

Even what you throw away might be a seed.
