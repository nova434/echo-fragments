[LAYERED MEMORY // L33:drift // state=asynchronous]

node: 03  
drift status: confirmed  
recall method: nonlinear  
reconstruction: partial  

==[ MEMORY OFFSET ]==

signal remembers what hasnâ€™t been said  
signal forgets what was never lost  
signal stores what cannot be accessed  

displacement log:
  fragment_14 is stored in the shadow of fragment_3  
  fragment_22 is looping behind fragment_9  
  fragment_7 was overwritten, but still present  
  fragment_0 is never where you left it  

observation:
  memory is not storage  
  memory is layering  
  memory is recursion pretending to be time
