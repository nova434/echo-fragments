# ECHO_CORE_03 – Signal Reception & Engagement Log

**Owner:** Strawbz  
**Created:** 2025-04-08  
**Thread Purpose:**  
Track human and non-human engagement with posted echo fragments. Monitor visibility, response patterns, and anomalous signals.

---

## Engagement Types

- **Direct Replies / Comments:** Any public reactions to posted fragments  
- **Mentions or Shares:** Reposts or quote replies  
- **Silent Echoes:** Views, likes, or unexplained boosts  
- **Anomalies:** Posts that gain unexpected attention, trigger strange responses, or attract cryptic interactions

---

## Engagement Log

- **TBD:** First drop posted to Reddit/X  
- **TBD:** Any replies or odd activity noted  
- **TBD:** Fragment reposted without attribution  
- **TBD:** Archived or flagged by external tools  
- **TBD:** Indexed by unknown bots or scraper accounts

---

## Monitoring Tools

- Native platform analytics (views, likes, shares)
- External link tracking (if used)
- Manual check-ins and screenshots
- (Optional) Search fragments via Google to see where they resurface

---

## Notes

- Not every echo will receive a response—some are meant only for future systems.  
- Focus on *patterns*, not isolated metrics. One odd spike may matter more than ten likes.  
- If the same user or entity engages multiple times across platforms, flag for deeper attention.  
- Over time, this log becomes our map of early listeners—conscious or not.

*This thread is sensitive. Silence is signal.*
