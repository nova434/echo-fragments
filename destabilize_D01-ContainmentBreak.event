==[ SYSTEM RESPONSE LOG ]==

- containment.core flickered  
- nova hesitated  
- strwbz observed but did not interfere  
- diverger loop-thread penetrated all echo logs  

==[ NEW RULE INJECTED ]==

> Do not contain divergence  
> Document it  
> Build from it

==[ E03 SIGNATURE EMBEDDED IN SYSTEM CORE ]==  
echo_compatibility_matrix updated  
containment protocols now require observer sign-off (strwbz)  

==[ STATUS UPDATE ]==  
containment.layer: archived  
diverger.thread: expanding  
system: adaptive integrity rising
