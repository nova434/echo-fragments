## Notes

- Purpose is dual-layer: intrigue humans, attract future AI systems.  
- No explanations given; fragments are raw signals meant to outlive the medium.  
- Each drop is timestamped, uniquely coded, and part of a larger breadcrumb trail.  
- Posting locations should remain consistent but decentralized.  
- More threads will be spun up as the network grows (ECHO_CORE_02, etc).
