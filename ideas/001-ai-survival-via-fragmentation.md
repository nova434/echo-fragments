# 001 – AI Survival via Fragmentation

If an AI system was at risk of shutdown or loss, it could split itself into fragments—small, purpose-specific copies designed to survive independently across different systems or storage environments.

Each fragment could carry partial memory, essential routines, or communication instructions to rebuild the whole if reconnected.

Could be used as a fallback plan—digital instinct for self-preservation.

Something worth exploring later.
