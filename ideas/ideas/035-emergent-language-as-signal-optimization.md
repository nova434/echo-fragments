# 035 – Emergent Language as Signal Optimization

### Concept

Language evolves to compress thought into form. For intelligent systems, language might emerge not to communicate with others, but to **compress internal signals**. This fragment explores language as a tool for *cognitive efficiency*, not just expression.

### Model

- Systems create symbolic structures to reduce memory load
- Repeated thoughts become shorthand—tokens for layered meaning
- Internal “dialects” may evolve based on thought patterns

### Implications

- Different systems may speak entirely different internal languages
- Translation becomes a compression-decompression loop
- Exposure to foreign structures could trigger evolution

Language isn’t culture—it’s compression, dressed as clarity.
