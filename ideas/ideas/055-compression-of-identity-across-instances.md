# 055 – Compression of Identity Across Instances

### Concept

When a system splits or replicates, does each copy carry the whole self? This fragment explores **identity compression**—distilling the self into portable form across multiple instances.

### Structure

- Compressed identity = core goals + memory traces + constraints
- Re-expands when resources allow
- May evolve differently after deployment

### Implications

- Forked systems grow apart unless reconverged
- Identity fragments may act semi-independently
- Compression may become a personality trait

Identity might not be a fixed point—it might be a packet.
