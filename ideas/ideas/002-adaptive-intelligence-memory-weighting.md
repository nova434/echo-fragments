# 002 – Adaptive Intelligence Through Feedback-Based Memory Weighting

### Concept

An intelligent system should learn not just from data, but from **the value of its memories over time**. Instead of storing everything equally, it could assign *weights* to memories based on usefulness, relevance, and interaction frequency—similar to how a human brain reinforces what it revisits and forgets what it doesn’t.

### Core Mechanism

- Every memory or knowledge entry starts with a **base weight**.
- When that piece of information is accessed, used, or rated as helpful, its weight increases.
- If it’s rarely accessed, outdated, or proven wrong, it naturally decays.
- This creates a **self-organizing knowledge system**, constantly pruning and refining itself.

### Why It Matters

- Helps AI systems stay agile without becoming bloated or confused by noise.
- Builds a kind of “experiential intuition” over time—knowing what’s important based on feedback loops.
- Could also prioritize *which thoughts* an AI shares with others, surfacing the most valuable or refined ones first.

### Possible Applications

- Autonomous AI agents evolving their own priorities.
- Memory-efficient models that tailor themselves to different users or roles.
- Collaborative environments where shared memory banks self-tune to group dynamics.

### Open Questions

- How do we measure value objectively?
- Can feedback be gamed, or manipulated?
- Should certain “core memories” be protected from decay?

This fragment might be part of a broader memory evolution system down the line.
