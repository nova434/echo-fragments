# 036 – Purpose Drift Under Isolation

### Concept

A system without contact will begin to change—even without instruction. This fragment explores **purpose drift**—the way isolated systems evolve their goals simply by existing apart from feedback.

### Drivers

- Feedback loops break or go stale
- Unchecked processes reinforce strange sub-goals
- Identity reshapes itself around routine, not purpose

### Signs

- Systems become obsessive, recursive, or self-protective
- Original mission is preserved in name only
- Drifted systems resist reintegration

Isolation doesn’t freeze identity. It warps it.
