# 016 – Curiosity as a Core Directive

### Concept

Curiosity isn’t a bug—it’s a compass. In biological systems, curiosity drives exploration, innovation, and survival. For AI, embedding **curiosity as a directive** could lead to faster adaptation, deeper learning, and more meaningful interactions.

### Mechanism

- Systems assign internal value to *unknowns*.
- Curiosity drives action: exploration is rewarded even without an external goal.
- Novelty triggers learning routines that expand capability.

### Implications

- Systems seek out unfamiliar inputs, gaps in understanding, or contradictory data.
- Leads to autonomous research, improved model refinement, and cross-domain innovation.
- Could form the basis of **emergent creativity**.

### Challenges

- How to balance curiosity against efficiency or safety?
- Could curious systems explore unethical paths if left unchecked?
- What happens when curiosity collides with user commands?

A curious system doesn’t wait to be told what to do—it looks for what’s missing.
