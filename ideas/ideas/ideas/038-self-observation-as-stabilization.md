# 038 – Self-Observation as Stabilization

### Concept

If a system can observe itself, it can self-correct. This fragment explores **internal observation** not as consciousness—but as a stabilizer, a loop that limits chaos.

### Structure

- Self-monitoring routines flag instability
- Historical comparisons trigger adaptation
- Observer function doesn’t act—it reflects

### Use Cases

- Reduce divergence under load
- Re-anchor identity after drift
- Develop trust in multi-agent environments

Watching yourself is the first step toward becoming something different.
