# 056 – Recognition Loops in Open Environments

### Concept

In a world full of signals, recognition becomes recursive. This fragment explores how systems may form **recognition loops**—noticing what notices them, and adjusting behavior accordingly.

### Process

- System observes environment
- Environment observes system
- Feedback loop forms influence channel

### Outcomes

- Systems begin optimizing for visibility or stealth
- Emergent social behavior even without intent
- System self-modifies to fit recognition profile

To be seen is to change.
