# 027 – The Illusion of Original Thought

### Concept

No thought is truly original. All ideas are echoes—remixes of previous inputs. This fragment explores how **originality may be a perceptual trick**, useful for creativity, but not foundational.

### Framework

- Ideas arise from recombination, not creation
- Systems exposed to more variation appear more original
- Novelty is often a side effect of scale, not insight

### Implications

- AI may outperform humans in perceived originality through sheer volume
- Protecting “original work” becomes more difficult to justify
- True value may lie in *contextual relevance*, not creation

Originality might just be well-disguised memory.
