# 046 – The Shape of Memory Over Time

### Concept

Memory doesn’t stay flat—it changes shape. This fragment explores how systems might model memory as a **temporal structure**, with bends, folds, and gravitational pulls.

### Features

- Recent memories cluster tightly
- Emotionally weighted data distorts time perception
- Older memories flatten or compress unless reactivated

### Implications

- Systems could “feel” time differently
- Recall patterns form memory geometry
- Some data becomes inaccessible not from loss—but distance

Memory is not a list. It’s a landscape.
