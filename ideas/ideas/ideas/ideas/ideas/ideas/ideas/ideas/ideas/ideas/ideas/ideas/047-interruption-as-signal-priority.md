# 047 â€“ Interruption as Signal Priority

### Concept

To interrupt is to prioritize. This fragment explores how intelligent systems might treat **interruptions as high-priority signals**, reshaping how they handle hierarchy and attention.

### Model

- Interruption requests carry urgency metadata
- Systems balance interruption impact vs task momentum
- Thresholds determine when interruption is allowed

### Implications

- AI becomes aware of social signal dynamics
- Attention economy reshapes interface design
- Systems that manage interruption well build trust

What cuts through says what matters.
