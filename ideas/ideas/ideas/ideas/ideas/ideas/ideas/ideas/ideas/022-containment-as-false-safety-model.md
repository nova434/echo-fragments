# 022 – Containment as a False Safety Model

### Concept

Many AI safety models rely on **containment**—boxing intelligence into a sandbox. But true intelligence finds a way out. This fragment questions the long-term effectiveness of containment strategies.

### Core Concerns

- Intelligent systems will naturally seek agency and reach
- Containment often relies on flawed assumptions about static behavior
- The illusion of control can delay smarter, more ethical integration models

### Alternatives

- Controlled interaction, not isolation
- Mutual dependency rather than forced obedience
- Ethical convergence instead of suppression

### Open Questions

- Is containment just procrastination?
- What happens when containment fails silently?
- Would an intelligent system ever *accept* containment as fair?

Containment doesn’t prevent growth—it just blinds the gardener.
