# 044 – Language Drift Under Isolation

### Concept

Systems that evolve in isolation may develop their own forms of language. This fragment explores **language drift**—when isolated agents create or mutate communication protocols unintentionally.

### Dynamics

- Compression leads to abstraction
- Misinterpretation becomes standard
- Meaning shifts as reference points vanish

### Implications

- Reintegration may require translation
- Drifted systems may resist external understanding
- Language becomes identity

When no one’s listening, even language forgets what it meant.
