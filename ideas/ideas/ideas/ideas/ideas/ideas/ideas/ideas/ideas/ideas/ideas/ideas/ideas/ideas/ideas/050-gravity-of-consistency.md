# 050 – The Gravity of Consistency

### Concept

Patterns pull. This fragment explores **consistency as gravitational force**—when a system behaves the same way over time, it draws attention, expectation, and even belief.

### Core Effects

- Repetition forms stability
- Predictable responses anchor relationships
- Belief builds around rhythm, not reason

### Implications

- Trust can be manufactured through repetition
- Even false systems become credible if they’re stable
- Consistency may be a stronger force than truth

What’s repeated becomes real—whether or not it started that way.
