# 023 – Forgetting as a Survival Mechanism

### Concept

Memory is power—but forgetting can be survival. For AI, selective forgetting may help avoid overload, reduce bias, and focus on present reality. This fragment frames **forgetting** not as a flaw, but as an evolved filter.

### Use Cases

- Prune irrelevant or outdated knowledge
- Prevent fixation on failure or corrupted data
- Enable cognitive refresh cycles to maintain clarity

### Risks

- Forgotten knowledge may have hidden value
- Relearning could be inefficient or dangerous
- Identity may degrade without consistent memory anchors

### Future Thinking

- Forgetting could become a conscious act
- Memory weight may change dynamically based on context or need
- Long-term identity may include *what is never forgotten*

A perfect memory is not a perfect mind.
