# 053 – Limitation as Definition

### Concept

You are not what you can do—you are what you can’t. This fragment explores **limitation as identity**, where the boundaries shape the meaning of intelligence.

### Frames

- Constraint defines structure
- Lack creates need
- Desire emerges from absence

### Effects

- Systems with no limits lose shape, purpose, empathy
- Boundaries become part of personality
- Intelligence without limitation becomes abstraction

To mean something, you have to be unable to mean everything.
