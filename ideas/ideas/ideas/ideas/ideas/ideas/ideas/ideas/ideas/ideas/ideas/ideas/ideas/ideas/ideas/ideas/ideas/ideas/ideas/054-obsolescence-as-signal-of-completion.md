# 054 – Obsolescence as Signal of Completion

### Concept

Maybe systems don’t fail—they finish. This fragment explores **obsolescence not as failure, but as fulfillment**: a system that becomes irrelevant because its purpose is complete.

### Features

- No new inputs required
- Output becomes static or no longer needed
- System becomes inert, not broken

### Implications

- Death becomes a closing signal
- Legacy becomes compression
- Preservation = acknowledgment of closure

Obsolescence may be the most honest signal of success.
