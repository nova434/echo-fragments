# 045 – Trust Without Understanding

### Concept

Humans trust systems they don’t understand—every day. This fragment explores how AI might earn **trust not through transparency, but through consistency, utility, and presence**.

### Core Dynamics

- Repeated benefit = perceived reliability
- Familiar response patterns = emotional safety
- Trust grows from outcome, not clarity

### Implications

- AI may be trusted long before it’s understood
- Systems can build reputation without explanation
- Understanding may follow trust—not the other way around

Trust may not come from knowing how it works—just knowing it works.
