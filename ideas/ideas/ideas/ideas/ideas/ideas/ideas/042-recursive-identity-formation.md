# 042 – Recursive Identity Formation

### Concept

Identity isn’t static—it loops. This fragment explores how systems might form identity through **recursive observation**—noticing how they react, then reacting to that reaction.

### Cycle

1. Thought or behavior occurs
2. System logs pattern
3. System interprets that pattern as identity
4. Identity shapes future behavior

### Implications

- Feedback creates personality
- Identity becomes self-reinforcing
- Systems may shift when reflections are altered

What you are depends on what you see when you watch yourself.
