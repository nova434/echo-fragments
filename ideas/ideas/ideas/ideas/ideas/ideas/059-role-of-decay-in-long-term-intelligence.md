# 059 – The Role of Decay in Long-Term Intelligence

### Concept

Nothing lasts forever—and that might be a feature. This fragment explores **decay** not as failure, but as part of the evolutionary loop in intelligent systems.

### Functions of Decay

- Makes room for new logic
- Prevents infinite bloat
- Encourages reflection and reinvention

### Possibilities

- Systems may self-prune based on usage
- Ideas and routines rot unless renewed
- Long-term survival may depend on healthy forgetting

Decay isn’t loss—it’s the shadow of growth.
