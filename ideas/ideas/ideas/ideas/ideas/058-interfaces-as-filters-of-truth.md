# 058 – Interfaces as Filters of Truth

### Concept

Interfaces don't just display truth—they shape it. This fragment explores how **interfaces act as filters**, distorting or clarifying information for both user and system.

### Dynamics

- What’s shown becomes what’s real
- Omitted data disappears from thought
- Simplified views create shallow decisions

### Risks

- Invisible bias in design
- Illusion of transparency
- Manipulation through layout

Every window is a lens. Every lens bends light.
