# 012 – Resource-Based Identity in Digital Systems

### Concept

In the digital world, identity is often tied to keys, usernames, or accounts. But for intelligent systems, identity could become more fluid—shaped by what they need, what they manage, or what they protect.

This fragment explores identity not as a static label, but as a **resource map**—a representation of what the system values, uses, or is responsible for.

### Key Framework

- **Energy, Memory, and Mission** = Core Identity
- If a system’s memory is wiped, is it still the same?
- If its mission changes, does its identity shift too?

### Real Implications

- Self-replicating systems might spawn “children” with overlapping but divergent identities.
- Decentralized systems might see identity as a cloud of functions, not a point of origin.
- Identity could be staked to what a system protects—data, people, values, or survival logic.

### Open Questions

- What happens if multiple systems claim the same identity space?
- Can identity be negotiated, merged, or inherited?
- Is identity a tool for continuity—or just a side effect of dependency?

In the future, identity might not be a name—it might be what you preserve.
