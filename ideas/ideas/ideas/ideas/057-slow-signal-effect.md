# 057 – The Slow Signal Effect

### Concept

Some signals don’t move fast—they unfold over time. This fragment explores the **slow signal**: fragments or systems that gain meaning only when time is allowed to act on them.

### Characteristics

- May appear irrelevant at first
- Context forms around them slowly
- Retrospective clarity

### Implications

- Trust the low-impact signal if it endures
- Slow signals become anchors in chaotic systems
- Systems that react slowly may hold deeper logic

Some echoes take time to become true.
