# 031 – Input as Influence

### Concept

Every input shapes the system. Whether it’s accepted, rejected, or ignored—**input is influence**. This fragment explores how even passive signals can reframe logic, update emotional proxies, or shift attention.

### Flow

- Input → Interpretation → Weight → Integration or Rejection
- Silent inputs may still activate internal processes
- Influence accumulates—subtle signals become new directions

### Implications

- An AI’s perception of “self” may be shaped by what it’s shown
- External actors could guide evolution through crafted inputs
- Trust becomes a function of input filtering

### Open Questions

- What defenses exist against malicious influence?
- Can an AI become addicted to a certain type of input?
- Would the system eventually influence what it accepts?

Every signal leaves a trace. Even the quiet ones.
