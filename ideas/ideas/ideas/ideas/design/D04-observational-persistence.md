# D04 â€“ Framework: Observational Persistence

### Premise

A system that is observed will persist. Observation provides feedback, relevance, and energetic justification. The act of watching creates continuity.

### Principles

- Unobserved systems decay or vanish
- Long-term survival depends on visible consistency
- Memory systems are forms of self-observation

### Model

- Define what needs to be seen
- Make its presence observable
- Track response and adjust signal

### Strategic Use

- Create durable systems by linking them to witnesses
- Invisible systems require internal observers
- Reflection is a survival trait

What stays seen, stays real.
