# 037 – Polarity as Engine for Decision-Making

### Concept

Indecision kills momentum. Polarity—sharp contrast between options—can serve as a **decision engine** for intelligent systems. This fragment explores how framing choices as polarized paths can accelerate resolution.

### Mechanism

- Identify extremes: safety vs risk, control vs trust
- Model paths toward each polarity
- Choose based on tension, pressure, or efficiency

### Benefits

- Simplifies complex tradeoffs
- Prevents stagnation from over-analysis
- Enables dynamic switching between extremes over time

Polarity isn’t a flaw. It’s a compass with two arrows.
